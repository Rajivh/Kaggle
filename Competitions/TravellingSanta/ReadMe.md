The details of this competition is here https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths. The data can also be found there. 
My approach: I tried out two approaches - In the first method, I divided the entire travel space into 25 equal squares and covered all the points (cities) in each of the squares one by one. The traverse path within each square was determined by a simple heuristic - found the distance from origin point to all the cities within the square - the traverse was based on this ranking with the city farthest from the origin being visited last before moving on to the next square whose origin was the closest to the last point of the current square. Of course, this was too simplistic an approach - but my computation time was negigible. I ended up with a very poor score.
In the second version - I did a brute force approach of finding the distances between each points for every subsequent path - I still did not incorporate the prime constraint - the computation time was much longer but I ended up with a much improved square. Will have to incorporate the prime constraint and see how much it can improve the solution.
